# Buck_regulator

For the values of R3 and R2, i calculated them according to formulas given in the LM5017 datasheet.

I couldn't change the text ratio in board layout as it was locked at 8%.

The Forward/Back Annotation is not active because i tried to keep the type 3 minimum ripple configuration in schematic only.
